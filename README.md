# Project for http://jamesleeand.com
## About This Repo
This repo shows the workflow files for my current portfolio http://jamesleeand.com.
## Site Builder Tools
In this project, I use the following for background building environment:
* `Gulp` for task automation
* `PostCSS` and the plugins - as the CSS preprocessor
* `Webpack` for bundling JS files
* `BrowserSync` as web server and 'gulp watch' changes to the codes
* `Babel` to convert ES6 to ES5 for web browser compatibility

## JS Framework
I use `AngularJS` (Angular 1) for my project.
### Data Binding
You can see data-binding between the model (json file) and template.
I also use ng-model and data filtering.
### Routing, i.e. Deep Linking
I use third party `angular-ui-router` instead of angular-route for usability and state functionality.
You can find the #!/ segment in the URL.

## CSS
I use `CSS animation` - keyframe, transform and transition.
Part of the CSS are inspired from `animate.css` and `hover.css`.
### Bootstrap
I use `Bootstrap` for responsive web design.
