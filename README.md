# Project for http://jamesleeand.com
## About This Repo
This repo shows the workflow files for my current portfolio http://jamesleeand.com.
## Site Builder Tools
In this project, I use the following for background building environment:
* Gulp for task automation
* PostCSS and the plugins - as the CSS preprocessor
* Webpack for bundling JS files
* BrowserSync as web server and 'gulp watch' changes to the codes
## JS Framework
I use AngularJS (Angular 1) for my project.
### Data Binding
You can see data-binding between the model (json file) and template.
### Routing, i.e. Deep Linking
I use third party angular-ui-router instead of angular-route for usability and state functionality.
You can find the #!/ segment in the URL.
