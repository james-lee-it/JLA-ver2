#Introduction
This is the workflow/raw files of jamesleeand.com.
In this project, I use AngularJS for data-binding and routing.

######Declaration:
I use Gulp-Starter for my building environment. Files are modified based on my project needs.
You can see the changes by going back to the very first commits. See commit lines.

The reason I use Gulp-Starter to kick off my project is for its completion and well-written structure. It helps speed up my project, so I can concentrate on building the actual codes. It also pays a good acknowledgement of the Gulp-Starter contributors' work. It is too good that I don't have to write it from scratch myself.
